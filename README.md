Create a fun, text-based Personality Quiz App that asks users a few questions and determines what type of person they are — for example, “The Thinker”, “The Adventurer”, or “The Creator”.  It’s an engaging project that uses logic, scoring, and conditional outputs — great for Python beginners to learn control flow and user interaction.
